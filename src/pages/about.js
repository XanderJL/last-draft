                What Is Ethical Storytelling?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Stories construct and define the lens through which we see the
                world. They are the catalysts of technological development,
                economic progress, social evolution, and positive change.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we say we practice ethical storytelling, we mean the
                creation and promotion of narratives that are honest, accurate,
                and grounded in a practice of mutual respect.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are all in relationship with one another. Itâ€™s why we are
                relationship-focused in everything we do.

                  Art and narrative are portals through which we explore new
                  ways to see in ourselves and each other. Through these
                  experiences, we become kinder, more connected beings.

                  The Last Draft is a stage that has been set to take readers
                  and viewers into artists homes, histories, and imaginations.
                  It is a virtual space for artists to share their work, discuss
                  their creative process, and learn from industry experts. We
                  aim to traverse the intersection of art, technology, and
                  business, curating a publication that functions both as
                  information hub and as creative outlet. Stories and content
                  are produced and shared through a variety of mediums.
